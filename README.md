# pyqt-googlemap-example

This is English version, by the way! If you want to see the Google map in your own country's language just get rid of the `hl="en"` at the end of the url. 

## How To Use
1. git clone ~
2. python -m pip install PyQt5-stubs - if this is not installed, QtWebEngineWidgets might not work
3. python -m pip install PyQtWebEngine
4. python main.py
