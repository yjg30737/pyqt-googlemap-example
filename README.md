# pyqt-googlemap-example
PyQt window which shows the Google map

Loading screen supported.

This is English version, by the way! If you want to see the Google map in your own country's language just get rid of the `hl="en"` at the end of the url. 

## How To Use
1. git clone ~
2. python -m pip install PyQt5-stubs - if this is not installed, QtWebEngineWidgets might not work
3. python -m pip install PyQtWebEngine - if Python IDE or something like that says that they can't find QtWebEngineWidgets or PyQt5.sip, put the `--upgrade` option behind of this command
4. python main.py
